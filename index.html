<h1>CSCI 5607 Project 4</h1>

<br>

<p>The majority of the way I implemented this project was by modifying the modelLoad file from homework 4. My implementation basically parses a text file with the map layout and generates a datastructure of "interactable" objects. It is a vector, but in hindsight I wish I had made it a nested dictionary. For each object, we render a different model, the walls are cubes and the doors are either teapots or knots. The keys are displayed as mini versions of the doors. One of my biggest challenges was figuring out how to get the keys to stay in the player view after being "picked up", because I thought I could just render it a certain distance away from cameraPos but along the lookAt direction, but then the objects would spin when the player turned around and I did not like that. I also had a little of trouble getting the player not to float in the air when looking slightly up because it did not even occur to me that movement in the Y direction was possible as someone who is so used to playing computer games where this is almost never possible (I think even in minecraft creative mode you do not move in the direction of your view, you only move in the Y direction with different keys from WASD). As a consequence of this and also for debugging purposes if you press "SHIFT" you can toggle flying mode! Again as someone so used to WASD controls, I did not think about what would be the easiest implementation of movement and instead went straight into figuring out how to tie rotation to mouse movement, and probably spent more time on that then I needed to. But it was fun!</p>

<p>The additional features I implemented were the video of course and the artistic screenshots. When I first read the project description I did not know what integrated keyboard and mouse control was but now that I am writing this I think I may have actually implemented it unintentionally.

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>I think it is pretty when the keys line up with the doors, so here are some pictures of that.</p>

<p>I also think the multicolored knots are pretty, and we have an arial view taken in flying mode as well.</p>
